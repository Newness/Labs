/**
A control that displays a repeating list of cells. It is suitable for displaying medium-sized
lists (maximum of ~100 items). A flyweight strategy is employed to render one 
set of cell controls as needed for as many cells as are contained in the repeater.

##Basic Use

A FlyweightGrid's components block contains the controls to be used for a single cell.
This set of controls will be rendered for each cell.

The onSetupCell event allows for customization of cell rendering. Here's a simple example:

	components: [
		{kind: "FlyweightGrid", cells: 100, minCellWidth: 150, onSetupCell: "setupCell", components: [
			{name: "item"}
		]}
	],
	setupCell: function(inSender, inEvent) {
		this.$.item.setContent("I am cell: " + inEvent.index);
	}
	
##Modifying Cells

Controls inside a FlyweightCell are non-interactive. This means that outside the onSetupCell event, 
calling methods that would otherwise cause rendering to occur will not do so (e.g. setContent).
A cell can be forced to render by calling the renderCell(inCell) method. In addition, a cell can be 
temporarily made interactive by calling the prepareCell(inCell) method. When interaction is complete, the
lockCell method should be called.
